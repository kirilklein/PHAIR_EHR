# Pipeline: Causal Inference for Patient Outcomes

! **This pipeline is under development and this is a template for the pipeline. Not all steps are available yet.**

This guide walks through the steps required to **estimate treatment effects** using patient encodings, outcome simulation, and causal inference techniques. The pipeline consists of:

1. [**Build Tree**](#1-build-tree)
2. [**Encode**](#2-encode)
3. [**Simulate Outcome**](#3-simulate-outcome)
4. [**Train MLP (on encodings)**](#4-train-mlp-on-encodings)
5. [**Estimate Treatment Effects**](#5-estimate-treatment-effects)

---

## 1. Build Tree

The `build_tree.py` script builds a hierarchical tree structure of diagnoses or medications at a specified level and saves it as a pickle file.
This tree representation helps organize medical codes into a structured format for further analysis. The purpose of this step is to generate a tree dictionary that can be used to generate an outcomes config file.

### 1.1 Usage

```bash
python -m corebehrt.main_causal.build_tree --type [diagnoses|medications] --level [INT]
```

### 1.2 Parameters

- `--type`: Type of data to build tree for (diagnoses or medications)
- `--level`: Level at which to build the tree (integer value)

### 1.3 Purpose

The tree structure enables:

- Organizing codes into a hierarchical representation
- Grouping related diagnoses or medications
- Creating structured outcomes for causal analysis
- Facilitating the generation of outcomes configurations for thousands of codes simultaneously

### 1.4 Outputs

- **Pickle file**: Contains the dictionary representation of the tree at the specified level
- Location: `./outputs/trees/[type]_tree_level_[level].pkl`

---

## 2. Encode

The `encode` script extracts patient encodings using a **fine-tuned model** and the **processed data** generated during the fine-tuning step.

### 2.1 Inputs

- Fine-tuned model
- Processed patient data from the fine-tuning script

### 2.2 Outputs

- **`encodings.pt`**: Patient-level vector representations

These encodings serve as inputs for downstream causal inference tasks.

---

## 3. Simulate Outcome

The `simulate` script generates synthetic patient outcomes using:

- Encodings from the **encode** step
- Predictions and targets from the fine-tuned model (files: `probas` and `predictions_and_targets`)

### 3.1 Configuration

Edit the **simulation configuration file**:

```yaml
# Simulation Parameters
outcome_model:
  type: sigmoid  # Sigmoid transformation of inputs
  params: {a: 1.5, b: 0.5, c: 0.2}  # Coefficients for simulation

# Counterfactual Generation
counterfactual:
  generate: true
  method: "inverse probability weighting"
```

### 3.2 Outcome Simulation Outputs

- **`simulated_outcomes.csv`**: Generated patient outcomes
- **`counterfactual_probas.csv`** (if enabled): Counterfactual outcome probabilities

---

## 4. Train MLP (on encodings)

The `train_mlp` script trains shallow **multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)** on the patient encodings to predict:

- **Simulated outcomes** (or)
- **Real target outcomes**

### 4.1 Finetuning Configuration

Edit the **training configuration file**:

```yaml
# Model Parameters
model_args:
  num_layers: 3
  hidden_dims: [256, 128, 64] # input is determined by the encoding size, output is one

trainer_args:
  batch_size: 128
  epochs: 50
  early_stopping: 5
  optimizer: adamw
  loss_function: binary_cross_entropy
```

### 4.2 Training Outputs

- **`mlp_probas.pt`**: Predicted probabilities from the shallow MLPs
- **`mlp_predictions.pt`**: Model predictions

---

## 5. Estimate Treatment Effects

The `estimate` script combines multiple sources of information to compute treatment effect estimates:

- **Fine-tuned model predictions and targets**
- **Shallow MLP predictions and targets**
- **Simulated counterfactual outcomes**

### 5.1 Estimation Methods

The script supports multiple causal inference techniques:

- **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)**
- **Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW)**
- **Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE)**
- **Matching-based methods**

### 5.2 Estimation Outputs

- **`treatment_effects.csv`**: Estimated treatment effects
- **`bootstrap_results.pt`** (if enabled): Bootstrapped standard errors
